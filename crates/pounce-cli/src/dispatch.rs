//! Solver routing for the LP/QP/QCQP dispatch.
//!
//! See `dev-notes/lp-qp-routing.md`. This module sits between problem
//! loading and the call to `optimize_tnlp`. It does three things:
//!
//! 1. **Classify** the parsed problem into a [`ProblemClass`] by walking
//!    the nonlinear expression trees the `.nl` reader already produced.
//! 2. **Resolve** that class against the user's `solver_selection`
//!    option into a [`SolverChoice`].
//! 3. **Dispatch** to the chosen solver (in `main.rs`).
//!
//! All solvers are wired: `auto` routes an LP/convex-QP to `pounce-convex`'s
//! interior-point solver, a convex QCQP to the same crate's conic (SOCP)
//! driver, and everything else to the existing filter-IPM (`Nlp`).
//!
//! ## Classification
//!
//! The `.nl` format has no dedicated quadratic section: each row's
//! linear part lives in the `G`/`J` coefficient segments (already split
//! out into [`NlProblem::obj_linear`] / [`NlProblem::con_linear`]),
//! while any higher-order term — including a QP's quadratic terms — is
//! written into the nonlinear expression tree as `Mul`/`Pow` nodes. So:
//!
//! - no nonlinear parts at all → **LP**;
//! - all nonlinear parts are degree-2 polynomials → **QP** family
//!   (convex / nonconvex / QCQP split by curvature);
//! - anything else (transcendental, higher degree) → **NLP**.
//!
//! ### Conservative fallback (correctness guard)
//!
//! Misclassifying an indefinite or non-quadratic problem *into* a convex
//! solver would return a spurious KKT point as if globally optimal.
//! Whenever the walk cannot *prove* the stronger class, the classifier
//! falls back to the more general one, ultimately `Nlp`. The convexity
//! (PSD) test uses a tolerance and routes "inconclusive within
//! tolerance" to the safe side, never to the convex path.
