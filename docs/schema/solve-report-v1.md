# POUNCE solve-report schema, v1

**Schema tag:** `pounce.solve-report/v1`

This document is the canonical reference for the JSON solve report
emitted by `pounce --json-output PATH` and `pounce_sens --json-output
PATH`. The report carries everything an AMPL `.sol` file holds —
status, primal `x`, dual `lambda`, suffix blocks — plus FAIR-aligned
provenance metadata and (optionally) the per-iteration trajectory.

Implementation: [`crates/pounce-cli/src/solve_report.rs`](../../crates/pounce-cli/src/solve_report.rs).

## Why a structured solve report?

Production NLP workflows often need to (a) capture which solve
produced which numbers for audit / reproducibility, (b) feed solver
output into downstream tooling (notebooks, dashboards, ML pipelines)
that don't want to parse a free-form `.sol` file, and (c) compare
runs across versions of pounce. Both upstream Ipopt's stdout summary
and AMPL's `.sol` were designed for human consumption and AMPL's
reader respectively — neither carries provenance metadata, neither is
schema-versioned, and neither is trivially machine-parseable across
ecosystems.

A versioned JSON schema with FAIR-aligned provenance solves all three.

## FAIR alignment

The `fair_metadata` block maps onto the four FAIR principles
(Wilkinson et al. 2016, "The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific
data management and stewardship", *Scientific Data* **3**, 160018, DOI
[10.1038/sdata.2016.18](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18); citation
verified via Crossref on 2026-05-14):

| Principle | Mapping in this schema |
|---|---|
| **F**indable | `result_id` (`<unix_nanos>-<pid>`, globally unique and time-ordered), `created_at_iso`, `created_at_unix_nanos`. |
| **A**ccessible | Plain-text JSON on disk; no protocol gating; UTF-8. Same trust model as the `.sol` file. |
| **I**nteroperable | Schema-versioned (`pounce.solve-report/v1`); JSON primitives only (no binary blobs); units documented per-field below; `solution.status` is the enum-variant string for cross-language consumption. |
| **R**eusable | `solver` (name + version + git commit + target triple), `license`, `input` (kind + path + size) capture enough provenance to reproduce a solve. |

## Versioning policy

`schema` is the version tag. Compatibility rules:

* **Adding fields** is non-breaking. Consumers MUST tolerate unknown
  fields. New optional fields land between versions; the major version
  doesn't bump.
* **Removing or renaming fields** bumps the major version (`v1` →
  `v2`). Consumers should pin against a major version (`schema
  starts_with "pounce.solve-report/v1"`).
* **Changing field semantics** without a rename is forbidden. If
  semantics need to change, add a new field and deprecate the old.

The pre-1.0 phase of POUNCE itself does NOT relax this rule for the
schema. Once a solve-report version ships, its field set is frozen
even while the rest of the solver is under churn.

## Top-level shape

```json
{
  "schema": "pounce.solve-report/v1",
  "fair_metadata": { ... },
  "problem":       { ... },
  "solution":      { ... },
  "statistics":    { ... },
  "iterations":    [ ... ]   // optional, omitted when empty
}
```

## Fields

### `schema` (string, required)

Identifier for this schema version. Always
`"pounce.solve-report/v1"` for v1. Major-version bumps change the
prefix; minor / patch (additive) changes do not.

### `fair_metadata` (object, required)

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `result_id` | string | Format: `<unix_nanos>-<process_id>`. Monotonically ordered within a process, globally unique across processes. No external UUID library needed. |
| `created_at_iso` | string | Solve start time as ISO-8601 UTC: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ`. |
| `created_at_unix_nanos` | integer | Same instant as Unix nanoseconds since 1970-01-01 UTC. Provided alongside the ISO string for consumers that prefer integer arithmetic. |
| `elapsed_seconds` | float | Wallclock seconds the solve took (matches `statistics.total_wallclock_time_secs` modulo float precision). |
| `solver` | object | See below. |
| `license` | string | SPDX identifier. Always `"EPL-2.0"` for this version. |
| `input` | object | See `Input descriptor` below. |

#### `solver` sub-object

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | Always `"pounce"`. |
| `version` | string | Crate version (e.g. `"0.1.0"`). Read from `CARGO_PKG_VERSION` at build time. |
| `git_commit` | string \| omitted | Build-time git revision. Omitted when the build environment did not set `POUNCE_GIT_COMMIT` (e.g. development builds). Set via `POUNCE_GIT_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse HEAD) cargo build` to populate. |
| `target_triple` | string | Build target triple (e.g. `"x86_64-apple-darwin"`); falls back to `"unknown"` when Cargo did not expose `TARGET` at build time. |

#### `Input descriptor` (`input`)

Tagged enum keyed on `kind`. Possible shapes:

```json
{ "kind": "nl-file", "path": "/path/to/foo.nl", "size_bytes": 366 }
{ "kind": "builtin", "name": "rosenbrock" }
{ "kind": "tnlp-direct" }
```

* `nl-file` — the input came from `.nl` file at `path`. `size_bytes`
  is present when the file's metadata is readable; consumers that want
  bit-exact provenance can hash the file themselves.
* `builtin` — the input was a built-in problem named by `name` (e.g.
  `pounce --problem rosenbrock`).
* `tnlp-direct` — used by library callers building a TNLP in-process
  without a `.nl` round-trip.

### `problem` (object, required)

Problem dimensions reported by the TNLP at `get_nlp_info()`.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `n_variables` | integer | Number of primal variables. |
| `n_constraints` | integer | Number of constraints (equalities + inequalities). |
| `n_objectives` | integer | Number of objectives. The IPM uses objective 0; extras are read but ignored. |
| `minimize` | boolean | `true` for minimization (the AMPL default). |
| `nnz_jac_g` | integer \| omitted | Number of declared non-zeros in the constraint Jacobian. |
| `nnz_h_lag` | integer \| omitted | Number of declared non-zeros in the lower triangle of the Lagrangian Hessian. |

### `solution` (object, required)

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `status` | string | `ApplicationReturnStatus` enum variant name verbatim (e.g. `"SolveSucceeded"`, `"MaximumIterationsExceeded"`). |
| `solve_result_num` | integer | AMPL-style solve-result code (Gay 2005, "Hooking Your Solver to AMPL" §5, p. 23 table): 0 = solved, 100-range = warning, 200-range = infeasible, 400-range = limit reached, 500-range = failure. |
| `objective` | float | Final unscaled objective value. `0.0` (not NaN) when the solve never completed; check `statistics.iteration_count > 0` to distinguish. |
| `x` | array of float \| empty | Primal vector, length `problem.n_variables`. Empty when the binary doesn't capture the final iterate (currently: `pounce` on the `newton_driver` fast-path). Omitted from JSON when empty. |
| `lambda` | array of float \| empty | Constraint multipliers, length `problem.n_constraints`. Same omission convention as `x`. |
| `suffixes` | array of object \| empty | sIPOPT-style suffix blocks; emitted only at `--json-detail full`. See below. |

#### Suffix entries

```json
{
  "name": "sens_sol_state_1",
  "target": "var",
  "kind": "real",
  "values": [0.576..., 0.378..., -0.046..., 4.5, 1.0]
}
```

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | AMPL suffix name. |
| `target` | string | One of `"var"`, `"con"`, `"obj"`, `"problem"`. Matches AMPL's `Sufkind_*` enum. |
| `kind` | string | `"real"` or `"int"`. Selects which payload array is populated. |
| `values` | array of float | Dense values (length = target dimension). Present when `kind = "real"`. |
| `int_values` | array of integer | Present when `kind = "int"`. |

### `statistics` (object, required)

Projection of `pounce_nlp::solve_statistics::SolveStatistics` minus
the per-iteration history (which lives at the top level when present).

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `iteration_count` | integer | Number of accepted outer iterations. |
| `final_objective` | float | Unscaled. Matches `solution.objective`. |
| `final_scaled_objective` | float | Scaled by the IPM's internal NLP scaling. Equal to `final_objective` when no scaling is in effect. |
| `final_dual_inf` | float | `||∇L||∞` at termination. |
| `final_constr_viol` | float | `||c(x)||∞` (primal infeasibility). |
| `final_compl` | float | Max complementarity over the four bound blocks. |
| `final_kkt_error` | float | Overall KKT error reported by the convergence check. |
| `num_obj_evals` | integer | `eval_f` call count. |
| `num_constr_evals` | integer | `eval_g` call count. |
| `num_obj_grad_evals` | integer | `eval_grad_f` count. |
| `num_constr_jac_evals` | integer | `eval_jac_g` count. |
| `num_hess_evals` | integer | `eval_h` count. |
| `total_wallclock_time_secs` | float | Wall time spent inside `optimize_*`. |
| `restoration_calls` | integer | Number of restoration-phase entries (pounce#12). |
| `restoration_inner_iters` | integer | Cumulative inner-IPM iterations across all restoration calls. |
| `restoration_outer_iters` | integer | Outer iterations that ran in restoration mode (`R`-line equivalents). |
| `restoration_wall_secs` | float | Wall time spent inside `perform_restoration`. |

Eval counters (`num_*_evals`) populate only on the `.nl`-file path
because the `pounce` binary's `CountingTnlp` wrapper tracks them.
Library callers using `IpoptApplication::optimize_tnlp` directly see
zeros there; the underlying counts are still available through
upstream's `IpoptCalculatedQuantities` if needed.

### `iterations` (array of object, optional)

Per-iteration trajectory. Emitted only at `--json-detail full` (when
`IpoptApplication::enable_iter_history()` was called). Omitted from
JSON entirely when empty.

Each row maps to one line of the upstream-formatted console iter
table. Fields:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `iter` | integer | 0-based iteration index. |
| `objective` | float | `f(x_k)` at the start of iter `k` (unscaled). |
| `inf_pr` | float | Primal infeasibility `||c(x_k)||∞`. |
| `inf_du` | float | Dual infeasibility `||∇L_k||∞`. |
| `mu` | float | Barrier parameter μ_k (not log10; consumers can take `log10` if they want the console format). |
| `d_norm` | float | `||d_xs||∞` of the search step taken at iter `k-1` to land at iter `k`. `0.0` at iter 0. |
| `regularization` | float | Hessian regularization `δ_w` applied this iter; `0.0` when none was needed. |
| `alpha_dual` | float | Dual step length. |
| `alpha_primal` | float | Primal step length. |
| `alpha_primal_char` | string (1 char) | Single-character tag (`f`, `h`, `r`, etc.) matching the alpha-primal column of upstream's iter table. |
| `ls_trials` | integer | Number of backtracking line-search trials this iter. |

## Detail levels

The `--json-detail LEVEL` flag selects how much detail is emitted.
Levels map to verbosity in the same spirit as upstream's `print_level`
(0 silent → 12 maximum debug):

| Level | What's emitted | What's omitted |
|---|---|---|
| `summary` (default) | FAIR metadata, problem, solution scalars + arrays, aggregate statistics | `iterations`, `solution.suffixes` |
| `full` | All of the above plus per-iteration trajectory and suffix blocks | nothing — full detail |

`summary` is the right choice for production logs and batch runs.
`full` is the debugging equivalent of upstream's `print_level=8`.

## Worked example

`pounce_sens crates/pounce-cli/tests/fixtures/parametric.nl out.sol --json-output result.json --json-detail full` produces (truncated for brevity):

## Consumer guidance

* **Pin the major version.** Check `schema.startswith("pounce.solve-report/v1")` before consuming.
* **Tolerate unknown fields.** New optional fields will land between minor versions of pounce. Use `serde(default)` / equivalent.
* **Distinguish "no solve" from "solve produced zero".** Pre-solve, scalar fields are `0.0` (not `NaN`, because JSON has no NaN literal). `statistics.iteration_count == 0` is the signal that no solve occurred.
* **`solution.x` / `solution.lambda` may be empty.** When the binary couldn't capture the final iterate (currently: the `pounce` binary on its `newton_driver` fast-path for `m=0, n≤1000` problems), the arrays are empty and the keys are omitted from JSON entirely. `pounce_sens` always populates them.
