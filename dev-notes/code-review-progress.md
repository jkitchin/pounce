# Code-review remediation progress (dev-notes/code-review-2026-06.md)

Worked one issue per `/loop` iteration: verify by running code → write a
regression test that fails pre-fix and passes post-fix → fix → `cargo test`.

## Status

| ID | Title (short) | Status | Notes |
|----|---------------|--------|-------|
| C1 | presolve: Phase-2 redundancy mask misaligned after Phase-0 row drop | **FIXED** | `apply_redundant_verdicts` helper guards on `row_kept_inner`; rollback path rebuilds `linear_rows`. Test `c1_redundancy_mask_realigned_after_phase0_drop`. |
| C2 | presolve: Phase-0 block elimination assumes non-block columns are constants (4 sub-cases) | **FIXED** | Conservative soundness gate rejects any block whose rows reference a free non-block column; `x_running` clamped to fixed value for trivially-fixed vars. Test `c2_gate_rejects_block_with_probe_hidden_free_dependency`. |
| H1 | qp: inertia-shift regularization silently discarded — unbounded QPs reported `Optimal` with δ-dependent garbage | **FIXED** (`solve_equality_only` path) | Re-verify unshifted stationarity `δ·‖x‖∞` after a shifted one-shot solve; report `Unbounded` when it exceeds `1e-3·‖g‖∞` (gradient scale, not `opt_tol`). Test `h1_zero_hessian_linear_objective_is_unbounded`; repointed `inertia_control_shift_succeeds_on_psd_singular_hessian` to a bounded singular case. |
| H2 | sensitivity: pin-row mapping omits `full_g_to_c_block` — silently wrong sensitivities with inequality constraints | **FIXED** | Translate user full-g pin indices through the c/d split before indexing `y_c`; reject pinned inequalities. Fixed `Solver::parametric_step`, `Solver::compute_reduced_hessian`, and the `convenience` (`SensSolve`) path; added `PdSensBacksolver::full_g_to_c_block` accessor. Tests in `cd_split_pin_mapping.rs`. |
| H3 | cli: `.sol`/JSON constraint duals written in internal c/d-split order, unscaled | **FIXED** | `on_converged` hook now reassembles `lambda` via `pack_lambda_for_user` (inverts the c/d split via `c_map`/`d_map` AND unwinds `c_scale`/`d_scale`) instead of concatenating raw `y_c`+`y_d`; manual concatenation kept only as a fallback for non-`OrigIpoptNlp`. Test `lambda_is_in_original_g_order_not_cd_split_order` in `json_report.rs`. |
| H4 | cli: convex LP/QP/SOCP dispatch ignores the `-AMPL` exit-code contract | **FIXED** | Threaded `args.ampl` into `run_convex_qp`/`run_convex_socp`; new `convex_exit_code(ok, ampl)` returns 0 for any non-fatal outcome under `-AMPL` (mirrors NLP path), 1 otherwise. Also dropped the `.sol`-write-failure `exit 2` (log-and-continue like the NLP path). Test `ampl_mode_honors_exit_code_contract_on_infeasible_convex_qp`. |
| H5 | nl: external-function errors detected on the wrong channel — failed evals silently return garbage | **FIXED** | `ExternalLibrary::eval` now decodes both `funcadd` error channels via `decode_external_errmsg`: the **reassigned** `al->Errmsg` pointer (conforming path) and the caller buffer. Previously only `errmsg_buf[0]` was checked, so a library doing `al->Errmsg = "...";` was invisible and the IPM consumed NaN f/∇f/∇²f. Tests `reassigned_errmsg_pointer_is_detected_end_to_end` + `decode_external_errmsg_buffer_and_none_channels`. |

## C1 detail

- **Bug**: `redundant_mask` from `find_redundant_rows` is aligned to the
  *kept* linear rows (`linear_rows`, filtered by `row_kept_inner`), but the
  mapping loop advanced the mask iterator on *every* `Some(linear_row)`,
  including ones Phase 0 already dropped. Every kept linear row after a
  Phase-0-dropped linear row received its predecessor's verdict → a binding
  constraint silently dropped, reinstated at postsolve with λ=0 (wrong answer).
- **Fix**: extracted `apply_redundant_verdicts()` which advances the mask only
  on rows that are both `Some` *and* still `row_kept_inner[i]`. Also made
  `linear_rows` mutable and rebuilt it to the full set inside the Phase-0
  rollback path (lines ~556-583), so the mask stays aligned with the restored
  all-kept mask there too.
- **Test**: `c1_redundancy_mask_realigned_after_phase0_drop` builds a
  3-linear-row map with inner row 0 dropped by Phase 0 and a mask flagging the
  2nd *kept* row; asserts the fixed helper drops inner row 2 (correct) while the
  inlined old loop drops inner row 1 (the documented bug). Deterministic, no FFI.
- **Verified**: `cargo test -p pounce-presolve` → 202 unit + 1 e2e + 9 doc, all pass.

## C2 detail

- **Bug**: Phase-0 block elimination drops a block's rows from the IPM problem
  but folds any *non-block* column into the RHS at a fixed value
  (`solve_linear_block` auxiliary.rs:551), and the residual check evaluates at
  that same point — so it can never catch a non-block column the IPM is still
  free to move. Four ways a free non-block column slips in: (a) a rejected
  earlier block leaves its columns free; (b) DM can leave a Square row adjacent
  to an Over column; (c) trivially-fixed vars are folded at probe value, not
  their fixed value; (d) a nonlinear row's derivative that is zero *at the
  probe* is dropped from incidence, hiding a real dependency. All four yield a
  feasible-looking presolve and a final solution silently violating the dropped
  equality. Opt-in (`presolve_auxiliary`), so not catastrophic today.
- **Fix**: conservative soundness gate (auxiliary.rs, before block solve) —
  scan each block row's **raw Jacobian sparsity** (not incidence, which drops
  probe-zero entries — covers (d)); if any non-block column is neither
  trivially fixed (`x_l==x_u`) nor pinned by an earlier accepted block
  (`fixed_mask`, updated on accept — covers (a)/(b)), reject the block as
  `NonBlockColumnFree`. Separately, clamp `x_running` to the fixed value for
  trivially-fixed vars at init — covers (c).
- **Test**: `c2_gate_rejects_block_with_probe_hidden_free_dependency` builds the
  (d) case (`x0 + x1^2 = 5`, ∂/∂x1=0 at probe x1=0) so incidence forms a clean
  square block {row0,x0} while x1 is a hidden free dependency; asserts the gate
  rejects (`blocks_eliminated==0`, reason `NonBlockColumnFree`).
- **Verified the bug by running code**: with the gate stubbed to `if false`,
  the same test eliminates the block (`blocks_eliminated: 1`) — the silent
  wrong elimination reproduced; restored gate → rejected. Full suite green
  (203 unit + 1 e2e + 9 doc); `pounce-cli`/`pounce-algorithm` build clean with
  the new enum variant.

## H1 detail

- **Bug**: `factorize_with_inertia_control` (solver.rs:104) returns the final
  diagonal shift δ it had to add to factor the KKT, but callers dropped it and
  declared stationarity from the *shifted* system `H+δI`. For `min gᵀx, H=0`
  (or any QP unbounded along a flat/negative-curvature direction) the shift
  regularizes the singular KKT and returns `x = -g/δ` — a δ-dependent garbage
  point — reported as `Optimal`. `QpStatus::Unbounded` was declared in
  `error.rs` but never constructed: unbounded detection did not exist.
- **Fix** (scoped to the one-shot `solve_equality_only` path, solver.rs:586):
  capture δ; the true unshifted primal stationarity residual is exactly `-δx`,
  so after a shifted solve (`δ > 0`) re-verify `δ·‖x‖∞`. A *bounded* singular
  QP regularizes to a min-norm point (residual ≈ `δ_initial·O(1)`, Tikhonov
  noise); an *unbounded* one blows `x` up like `‖g_null‖/δ` (residual ≈
  `‖g_null‖ = O(‖g‖)`) — an ~8-order gap. Threshold is `1e-3·max(‖g‖∞, 1)`
  (gradient scale), **not** `opt_tol`: `opt_tol`=1e-9 < `inertia_shift_initial`
  =1e-8, so comparing to `opt_tol` would false-positive every bounded shifted
  solve. On trip, return `QpStatus::Unbounded` with `obj = -∞`.
- **Scope note**: the other six shift call sites (238/384/441/682/943/1569)
  share the root cause but are iterative paths where a *transient* shift on one
  inner iteration is normal and must not abort — re-verifying there needs the
  shift to persist to convergence, so those are deliberately left for a
  follow-up. H1's concrete reproducer (`min gᵀx, H=0`) routes through
  `solve_equality_only`, which is fixed.
- **Test**: `h1_zero_hessian_linear_objective_is_unbounded` (`H=0`, `g=(1,-2)`,
  no constraints, infinite bounds) asserts `status == Unbounded`. Also
  repointed the pre-existing `inertia_control_shift_succeeds_on_psd_singular_hessian`
  from `g=(-1,-2)` (which is *genuinely unbounded* and was wrongly asserting
  `Optimal` — it encoded the bug) to `g=(0,-2)` (bounded singular: g has no
  component along the null direction), which still exercises the shift
  mechanism and correctly stays `Optimal`.
- **Verified the bug by running code**: neutralizing the new guard
  (`if false && delta > 0.0`) makes `h1_…` report `Optimal` with
  `x = [-1e8, 2e8]` (the δ-dependent clamp point) — the bug reproduced;
  restored → `Unbounded`. Full `pounce-qp` suite green (71 unit + tests).

## H2 detail

- **Bug**: the pin-constraint → KKT-row mapping computed the flat row of a
  pinned equality as `n_x + n_s + user_g_index`, but the `y_c` multiplier
  block holds **equality rows only**. With any inequality preceding the pinned
  equality in `g(x)`, the inequality lands in the `d` block and shifts every
  later equality's `y_c` position down — so the raw user index selects the
  wrong constraint's row (or a `y_d`/slack row) and `parametric_step` /
  `compute_reduced_hessian` return plausible-but-wrong numbers with no error.
  Three sites: `Solver::parametric_step` (solver.rs:316), `Solver::compute_reduced_hessian`
  (solver.rs:357), and the `convenience`/`SensSolve` closure (convenience.rs:285).
  The CLI driver (`pounce-cli/src/sens.rs`) already did it right via
  `full_g_to_c_block` — duplicated logic that had diverged. Existing tests
  passed only because every fixture was equality-only (identity c-map).
- **Fix**: route all three sites through the c/d-split map. Added
  `PdSensBacksolver::full_g_to_c_block` (delegates to the held NLP) and a
  `pin_rows_for` helper in solver.rs; convenience.rs translates inline against
  its `nlp` handle. A pinned inequality (no `y_c` row) is now rejected with an
  error instead of silently pinning a `d`/slack row.
- **Test** (`tests/cd_split_pin_mapping.rs`): a fixture with one inactive
  leading inequality then three equalities (`min x0²` s.t. `x0+x1+x2≤1000`,
  `x0=x1+x2`, `x1=p1`, `x2=p2`). Pinning the x1-fixing equality must move x1
  and x0 but not x2 (`dx=[Δ,Δ,0]`); the pre-fix bug pins the x2-fixing
  equality instead. Plus two inequality-rejection tests (parametric_step and
  reduced_hessian).
- **Verified the bug by running code**: pre-fix, the new test reported
  `dx=[0.1, 0, …]` (x1 unmoved — wrong row pinned) and pinning the inequality
  returned `Ok([0.1, 0, 0])` silently; post-fix → `dx=[0.1,0.1,0]` and the
  inequality is rejected. Full `pounce-sensitivity` suite green (43 + 6 + 3 + …
  across test bins); `pounce-cli` builds clean.

## H3 detail

- **Bug**: the `on_converged` hook (`pounce-cli/src/main.rs:602-624`) built the
  captured `lambda` as the raw internal multipliers — all `y_c` (equalities)
  expanded, then all `y_d` (inequalities) expanded. But `OrigIpoptNlp` splits
  the user's `g(x)` into c (equality) and d (inequality) blocks *interleaved by
  original `.nl` g-index* (`c_map`/`d_map`), and the canonical
  `pack_lambda_for_user` both inverts that permutation **and** unwinds the
  `c_scale`/`d_scale` scaling. The hook did neither, so on any `.nl` with
  interleaved eq/ineq rows the JSON/`.sol` dual block was permuted (AMPL/Pyomo
  read it positionally → each constraint gets the wrong dual), and off by scale
  factors whenever default `gradient-based` scaling fires. The correct backfill
  at main.rs:934-938 only ran when the nominal capture was empty (active-set
  route), so the NLP path always took the buggy branch.
- **Fix**: reassemble via `nlp.borrow().pack_lambda_for_user(&*curr.y_c,
  &*curr.y_d)`; keep the raw `y_c`-then-`y_d` concatenation only as a fallback
  for a non-`OrigIpoptNlp` whose trait default returns an empty vector.
- **Test** (`json_report.rs::lambda_is_in_original_g_order_not_cd_split_order`):
  pyomo-generated `dual_order.nl` interleaves `g0: x ≤ 2` (active inequality,
  dual ≈ 2) then `g1: y == 1` (equality, dual ≈ 58). Correct g-order is
  `lambda = [≈2, ≈58]`; the pre-fix concatenation gives `[≈58, ≈2]`. Magnitudes
  an order apart so the swap is unambiguous regardless of sign convention. Runs
  the binary with `solver_selection=nlp` to force the general filter-IPM path.
- **Verified the bug by running code**: pre-fix binary emitted
  `lambda = [58.0, 2.0]` on `dual_order.nl`; post-fix → `[2.0, 58.0]`. Forcing
  the fallback branch (`if true || lambda.is_empty()`) reproduced the failure in
  the test harness (`lambda[0] = 58 expected ≈2`); restored → green. Full
  `pounce-cli` suite green (154 unit + all integration bins).

## H4 detail

- **Bug**: `run_convex_qp` (`pounce-cli/src/main.rs`) and `run_convex_socp`
  never received `args.ampl` and ended with `if ok { SUCCESS } else { from(1) }`
  — exit 1 on every non-fatal *unsuccessful* outcome (infeasible / unbounded /
  iteration limit). But these paths handle every default-routed (`auto`)
  LP / convex-QP / QCQP `.nl`, and the AMPL solver protocol conveys termination
  through the `.sol`'s `solve_result_num`: a non-zero process exit makes Pyomo /
  the ASL interface raise `ApplicationError` and never read the `.sol`. The NLP
  path already documents and implements this (`_ if args.ampl => SUCCESS`,
  main.rs:1116). So `pounce model.nl -AMPL` on an infeasible LP broke the Pyomo
  integration. Secondary inconsistency: a failed `.sol` write exited 2 on the
  convex paths but only logged-and-continued on the NLP path.
- **Fix**: thread `args.ampl` into both functions; extract
  `convex_exit_code(ok, ampl) -> ExitCode` returning `SUCCESS` when `ok || ampl`
  (mirrors the NLP contract) and `1` otherwise. Dropped the two
  `.sol`-write-failure `return ExitCode::from(2)` early-returns in favor of
  log-and-continue, matching the NLP path so the exit code uniformly follows the
  solve outcome.
- **Test** (`qp_dispatch_end_to_end.rs::ampl_mode_honors_exit_code_contract_on_infeasible_convex_qp`):
  runs the infeasible-QP fixture both ways — `-AMPL --sol-output` must exit 0
  with the verdict (`solve_result_num` 200) written to the `.sol`; plain
  `--no-sol` must still exit non-zero. The existing
  `infeasible_qp_reports_infeasible` (non-AMPL, exit non-zero) is unchanged.
- **Verified the bug by running code**: pre-fix binary exited 1 on
  `infeasible_qp.nl -AMPL` (with the `.sol` written); post-fix → exit 0, and
  non-AMPL stays exit 1 / feasible `-AMPL` exits 0. Neutralizing the `|| ampl`
  guard reproduced the test failure (`right: Some(0)`); restored → green. Full
  `pounce-cli` suite green (154 unit + integration; qp_dispatch 16 tests).

## H5 detail

- **Bug**: the AMPL `funcadd` ABI lets an external library report an error two
  ways. The conforming path is to **reassign** `arglist.errmsg` to the
  library's own string (`al->Errmsg = "T out of range";`); the alternative is
  to write into a caller-provided buffer. `ExternalLibrary::eval`
  (`pounce-nl/src/nl_external.rs`) pre-pointed `al.errmsg` at a zeroed 1024-byte
  buffer and only checked `errmsg_buf[0] != 0` afterward. A library that
  reassigns the pointer (the standard behavior — e.g. IDAES Helmholtz on
  out-of-domain `(h,p)`) leaves the buffer untouched, so the error was
  invisible: `eval` returned `Ok` with the function's NaN/garbage value. This
  defeated the NaN-poisoning design in `nl_tape.rs::ext_eval_or_nan` (written so
  the line search backs off on out-of-domain evals); the IPM silently consumed
  wrong f/∇f/∇²f.
- **Fix**: remember the buffer's address, and after the call decode via a new
  `decode_external_errmsg(errmsg_field, orig_buf_ptr, buf_first)`: if the field
  no longer equals our buffer (and is non-null) the library reassigned it →
  read from the new pointer; otherwise fall back to the buffer when its first
  byte is non-zero; else no error.
- **Test**: `reassigned_errmsg_pointer_is_detected_end_to_end` builds the real
  `Arglist` and invokes a conforming Rust `extern "C"` `rfunc` that reassigns
  `al->Errmsg` to a static string and returns NaN — exercising the real
  function-pointer call and the real post-call decode. It asserts the caller
  buffer stays zeroed (so the pre-fix `errmsg_buf[0]` check saw nothing) and
  that the fixed decode surfaces `"T out of range"`.
  `decode_external_errmsg_buffer_and_none_channels` covers the buffer-write
  channel and the no-error / explicit-NULL cases.
- **Verified the bug by running code**: the end-to-end test demonstrates
  channel 1 in-process — after a reassigning call `errmsg_buf[0] == 0`, proving
  the old check was blind to it, while `decode_external_errmsg` returns
  `Some("T out of range")`. Full `pounce-nl` suite green (75 + …); no external
  dylib required (the IDAES-dependent tests still skip when absent).
